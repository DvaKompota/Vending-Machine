# Vending-Machine

## For launching Vending Machine with UI — run `app.py`
You will need to install PyQt5:
```
pip install PyQt5
```

## For launching text version of Vending Machine — run `VendingMachine.py`


## Problem Statement
You need to design a Vending Machine which accepts coins of 1,5,10,25 Cents i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.
Allow user to select products Coke(25), Pepsi(35), Soda(45).
Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
Return selected product and remaining change if any.
While a UI would be awesome, the expectation is that this is a program run on the command-line, which will accept input via keyboard.
Choose what language you want, extra credit for Python 3.

### Expected results:
```
>>> python3 VendingMachine.py
>>> Vending Machine> What would you like to drink?
>>> Keyboard Entry> Coke,1Q
>>> Vending Machine> Here you go, enjoy!

>>> Vending Machine> What would you like to drink?
>>> Keyboard Entry> Coke,1D
>>> Vending Machine> Sorry, you need more money for that.

>>> Vending Machine> What would you like to drink?
>>> Keyboard Entry> Coke,3D
>>> Vending Machine> Here you go, enjoy! Your change is 1N
```

Q=quarter, D=dime, N=nickel, P=penny
