# Problem Statement
# You need to design a Vending Machine which
# Accepts coins of 1,5,10,25 Cents i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.
# Allow user to select products Coke(25), Pepsi(35), Soda(45)
# Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
# Return selected product and remaining change if any.
# While a UI would be awesome, the expectation is that this is a program
# run on the command-line, which will accept input via keyboard.
# Choose what language you want, extra credit for Python 3.
#
# Expected results:
# > python3 VendingMachine.py
# Vending Machine> What would you like to drink?
# Keyboard Entry> Coke,1Q
# Vending Machine> Here you go, enjoy!
#
# Vending Machine> What would you like to drink?
# Keyboard Entry> Coke,1D
# Vending Machine> Sorry, you need more money for that.
#
# Vending Machine> What would you like to drink?
# Keyboard Entry> Coke,3D
# Vending Machine> Here you go, enjoy! Your change is 1N
#
# Q=quarter, D=dime, N=nickel, P=penny
